## 1. Activity Summary

**Melvin**: 

Worked with Rique to design the website to hold/fetch the information he organized.

**Chris**: 

Created two diagrams for the Midterm presetnation. One UML Use case, and one class diagram.

**Mark**: 

Prepared the midterm slideshow and managed the team to prepare and populate the slides.

**Rique**: 

Worked with Melvin to design a function using JavaScript to create a heroes section for any new hero added to a dictionary.

# 2. Retrospective

Appreciations: Melvin was picked because he took responsibility and gathered data for the website on his own.

Successes: Team had reached the 5 minute minimum for the presentation. 

Failures: This week, because of midterms, the team was not able to make progress on the website and the teams wasnt able to meet more than once this week.

Barries: Database server. Currently we simply do not have the hardware needed to implement a back end.

What we should try next time: Again, we will try to meet more than once this week to communicate and get progress on the website.

## 3. Next Steps

Tasks (GOALS)
- Mark will try to get the server hardware to enable the team to have backend access
- Rique and Melvin will continue to work on separate html files to display data gathered (heroes, stats, etc.).
- Chris will work on getting a local Django backend. Once the server is secured, he'll port over the local backend.
