# Deliverable 3:

**System Description**

The problem of overcomplication in learning how to play **Marvel Rivals** affects new players who are interested in getting into the game, leading to wasted time spent on understanding the *game mechanics*, frustration, and potential abandonment before they experience its full potential. For new **Marvel Rivals** players who don't have enough time to learn the in-depth *mechanics*, **CounterPick.gg** is a website designed to simplify and organize essential *gameplay information*. Unlike **MarvelRivals.com**, which primarily focuses on selling the game, **CounterPick.gg** is a dedicated teaching platform that presents key *strategies* and *mechanics* in a clear, concise, and user-friendly manner. This allows **Players** to grasp the fundamentals quickly and enjoy the game without feeling overwhelmed. The value **CounterPick.gg** provides is a faster, less frustrating learning experience, enabling **Players** to jump into the game and engage effectively.

The system must support several **Functional Requirements** to ensure an optimal user experience. The **User Interface** must be intuitive, allowing new **Players** to easily navigate the platform. A **Hero Index** will serve as a database of all **Heroes**, providing key *abilities*, *counters*, and *team synergies*. A **Tier List** will rank **Heroes** based on *competitive viability*. **Comp Meta** will display viable **Team Compositions** based on *current game balance*. The **Account System** allows **Users** to create and manage their **Profiles**, enabling features such as saving *favorite heroes* or *compositions*. **Patch Notes** and **Community Notes** will keep **Players** informed about *game updates* and allow **Users** to contribute *user-generated content*. The **Search Bar** will provide a quick way to locate specific **Heroes**, *strategies*, or **Compositions**.

**Non-functional Requirements** The platform's **Performance Efficiency** ensures it can handle increasing ***Workload*** as more **Users** access the system, maintaining responsiveness under high demand by optimizing resource usage and processing speed. To enhance **Usability**, ***Readability*** is prioritized so that *game data* is presented in a clear and digestible format, making it easier for **Users** to interpret and navigate. Additionally, **Compatibility** is essential, ensuring ***Compatibility*** across desktops, tablets, and mobile devices so that **Users** have a consistent experience regardless of their hardware or operating system. Both **Functional Suitability** and **Usability** contribute to ***Responsiveness***, allowing the platform to adapt efficiently to different screen sizes and interaction modes, ensuring a smooth and interactive experience. **Security** is a key concern, with ***Security*** measures in place to protect **User Data** from unauthorized access, breaches, and corruption through encryption, authentication, and access control mechanisms. Lastly, **Supportability** is addressed through ***User Support***, which will assist **Players** with any *issues* or *questions* by providing documentation, live assistance, or automated help systems, ensuring a seamless and reliable user experience.

**The Minimum Viable Product (MVP)** for **CounterPick.gg** consists of a **Landing Page**, **Working Links**, and **Accurate Data**. The **Landing Page** will serve as an entry point, guiding **Users** to the correct sections. Testing will verify that all elements load correctly, the layout is responsive on different devices, and navigation is intuitive. **Working Links** ensure smooth navigation throughout the platform. Testing will include automated and manual link validation to confirm that all internal and external links direct **Users** to the intended destinations without errors. **Accurate Data** guarantees that **Players** receive the most up-to-date game information. Testing will involve data integrity checks, comparing displayed information with verified game sources, and implementing automated alerts for discrepancies.  

At any time, a User can update the Team Composition in the Team Comp Tool by selecting or removing Heroes to see updated stats. Users can also view Hero Stats by navigating the Hero Index. When a new Hero is added, a Developer updates the Hero Index to ensure accurate data. New Users can create accounts by providing credentials and verifying their email. No estimate for time or priority level is provided.

New players want easy access to patch notes so they can stay up to date with game changes, while veterans want to contribute community insights to help others. Competitive players need real-time meta updates, and coaches require a fast way to theory craft optimal team compositions. Veterans track viable team compositions in competitive play, while new players seek guidance on the best heroes to learn. A clear and accessible website allows players to find hero stats and patch notes quickly. The goal is to have a functional website by the third quarter of the semester.

For issue tracking, the project maintains an **Issue Tracker** at [GitHub](https://github.com/Rique-Yazzie/cs386-a1/issues), ensuring that *bugs*, *feature requests*, and *system improvements* are documented and addressed systematically.
